# Cross-Walk
This Python Program uses a number of user defined functions, callback functions, boolean variables, lists, and an infiniate while loop to set up a therotical cross walk. The hardware componets used for this project was an LDC screen, two small LED traffic lights, and two buttons all connected to a Raspberry Pi through a breadboard. The while loops runs constantly telling the cars to drive, slow down, and stop (using the traffic lights and the LCD screen), until it is interrupted by the pressing of one of the buttons. When this happens the traffic lights both display yellow then red, and the LCD screen indicates which button was pressed (east or west) for a short period of time, allowing a pedestrian to cross, and then traffic resumes as usual until a button is pressed again.
